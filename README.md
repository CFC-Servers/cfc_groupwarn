## Installation
Simply download a copy of the zip, or clone the repository straight into your addons folder!

### Download
The latest pre-compiled versions are available in **[Releases](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/cfc_groupwarn/releases/)**

### Git Clone
Because this project uses Moonscript, keeping it updated via `git` is _slightly_ more involved.

The [`lua` branch](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/cfc_groupwarn/tree/lua) is a lua-only branch containing the compiled code from the most recent release. You can use this branch to keep `cfc_groupwarn` up to date.
```sh
git clone --single-branch --branch lua git@github.com:CFC-Servers/cfc_groupwarn.git
```

## Usage
No special configuration needed!

Once it's installed, it'll just work.
